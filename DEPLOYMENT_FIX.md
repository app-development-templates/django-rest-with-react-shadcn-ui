# Dokploy Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Issues Fixed

- [x] **Port Conflicts Resolved**: Removed all external port mappings (`ports:`) from docker-compose.yml
- [x] **Internal Networking**: Services now use `expose:` for internal communication only
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Made all configurations environment-based
- [x] **Security Settings**: Added proper Django production settings
- [x] **Dokploy Labels**: Added service identification labels

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **In Dokploy UI:**
   - Repository: `https://github.com/app-development-templates/django-rest-with-react-shadcn-ui.git`
   - Docker Compose file: `docker-compose.yml` (now production-ready)
   
2. **Environment Variables to Set:**
   ```
   DB_PASSWORD=your-secure-database-password
   SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key-here
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
   ```

3. **Dokploy will automatically:**
   - Assign external ports to your services
   - Handle SSL certificates
   - Provide domain access

## 🔍 What Changed

**Before (causing errors):**
```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:3000"  # ❌ Conflicts with existing services
  - "8000:8000"  # ❌ Hard-coded port binding
```

**After (fixed):**
```yaml
expose:
  - "3000"       # ✅ Internal access only
  - "8000"       # ✅ Dokploy handles external mapping
```

## 📝 Notes

- Database service has no external exposure (security best practice)
- Frontend and backend communicate internally via Docker network
- Dokploy handles external access and domain routing
- All services properly wait for dependencies (db health check)

The deployment should now succeed without port conflicts! 🎉
