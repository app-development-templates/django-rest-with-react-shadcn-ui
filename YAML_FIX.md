# 🚨 YAML Syntax Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
```
Error ❌ bad indentation of a mapping entry (85:7)
|       nofile:
|         soft: 65536
|         hard: 65536
|       - dokploy-network
```

## Root Cause
The `ulimits` and `networks` sections were incorrectly nested in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Solution Applied
Fixed the YAML structure by reordering the sections in the frontend service:

**Before (broken):**
```yaml
networks:
  - app-network
ulimits:
  nofile:
    soft: 65536
    hard: 65536
```

**After (fixed):**
```yaml
ulimits:
  nofile:
    soft: 65536
    hard: 65536
networks:
  - app-network
```

## ✅ Status
- **docker-compose.yml**: Fixed and validated ✅
- **docker-compose.prod.yml**: Fixed and validated ✅
- **Configuration**: Both files now parse correctly ✅

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment
Your Dokploy deployment should now proceed without YAML parsing errors!

The configuration includes:
- ✅ No port conflicts (using expose only)
- ✅ EMFILE fix (polling enabled)
- ✅ Traefik labels for routing
- ✅ Proper file descriptor limits
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax
