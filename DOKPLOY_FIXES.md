# Dokploy Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues with Dokploy.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Conflicts
**Problem**: Ports 5432 and 3000 were hardcoded and conflicting with Dokploy's port allocation.
**Solution**: 
- Removed hardcoded port mappings from docker-compose.yml
- Used `expose` instead of `ports` for internal communication
- Let Dokploy handle external port mapping through Traefik

### 2. YAML Syntax Errors
**Problem**: Invalid YAML structure in docker-compose files.
**Solution**: Fixed indentation and syntax issues in all compose files.

### 3. File System Watcher Issues (EMFILE)
**Problem**: Too many file watchers causing "EMFILE: too many open files" errors.
**Solution**: 
- Added polling for file watching (`CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`)
- Increased file descriptor limits with ulimits
- Added watchpack polling for Vite

### 4. Domain/Host Configuration
**Problem**: Vite blocking requests from production domains.
**Solution**: 
- Updated vite.config.js with `allowedHosts` for presentationlab.org domains
- Configured proper CORS origins for production
- Set ALLOWED_HOSTS for Django

### 5. Database Authentication
**Problem**: PostgreSQL authentication failures due to inconsistent credentials.
**Solution**: 
- Standardized database credentials (postgres/coursesapp123)
- Updated .env file with correct credentials
- Ensured consistency across all configuration files

### 6. Development Server in Production
**Problem**: Django development server warnings in production logs.
**Solution**: 
- Added Gunicorn WSGI server (gunicorn==23.0.0)
- Created production-optimized gunicorn.conf.py
- Updated production commands to use Gunicorn instead of runserver

### 7. Production Optimization
**Problem**: Development Dockerfiles not optimized for production.
**Solution**: 
- Created Dockerfile.prod for both frontend and backend
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Production nginx configuration
- Security hardening and health checks

## Production Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DEBUG=0` - Disable debug mode
- `SECRET_KEY` - Use secure production secret
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Restrict to production domains
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Allow only frontend domain
- `VITE_API_URL` - Point to production backend

### Traefik Labels
- Automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt
- Domain-based routing for frontend.presentationlab.org and backend.presentationlab.org
- Load balancer configuration

### Security Features
- Non-root users in containers
- Security headers in nginx
- Health checks for monitoring
- Resource limits and restart policies

## Deployment Commands

For development:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

For production (Dokploy):
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration with networking
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production overrides
- `vite.config.js` - Host and polling configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Added Gunicorn
- `nginx.conf` - Port 3000 configuration
- `.env` - Database credentials

### Created Files:
- `gunicorn.conf.py` - Production WSGI configuration
- `django-rest-api/Dockerfile.prod` - Production backend container
- Updated `react-shadcn-ui/Dockerfile.prod` - Production frontend container

## Production Checklist

✅ Port conflicts resolved  
✅ YAML validation passes  
✅ File watcher issues fixed  
✅ Domain configuration set  
✅ Database authentication working  
✅ Production server (Gunicorn) configured  
✅ Production Dockerfiles optimized  
✅ Traefik routing configured  
✅ SSL certificates configured  
✅ Security hardening applied  

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Dokploy using the production configuration
2. Verify SSL certificates are generated automatically
3. Test application functionality on production domains
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
5. Set up proper monitoring and backup strategies

The application is now production-ready and should deploy successfully on Dokploy!
