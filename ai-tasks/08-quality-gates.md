# Task: Run Deployment Quality Gates

## Goal
Ensure the Django backend passes automated quality checks prior to production deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Access to run management commands within the production-like environment.

## Steps
1. **Django System Checks**
   - Execute `python manage.py check --deploy`.
   - Resolve all warnings/errors, documenting any intentional exceptions.
2. **Automated Tests**
   - Run `python manage.py test` targeting the PostgreSQL database.
   - Add coverage requirements to CI to maintain quality over time.
3. **Smoke Tests**
   - After deploying to staging, run smoke tests covering authentication, module listing, and reward bidding endpoints.
   - Capture results in release notes for traceability.
4. **CI/CD Enforcement**
   - Update pipeline to block deployments if any of the above checks fail.
