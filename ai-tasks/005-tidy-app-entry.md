# Task 005: Tidy App Entry File

## Goal
Clean up `react-shadcn-ui/src/App.jsx` so it adheres to lint expectations and established import casing.

## Steps
- Remove the unused default `react` import (or replace it with `React` only if needed).
- Run lint/formatting to confirm no additional unused imports remain in the entry file.
- Smoke-test the app to ensure routing still works after the import cleanup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `App.jsx` no longer imports unused symbols, and the file casing matches project conventions.
- The application renders as before with no runtime warnings introduced by the change.
